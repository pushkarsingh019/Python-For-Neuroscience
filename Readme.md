# Functions for Behavioural Neuroscience and Neurophysiology.

This repo contains python notebook whihc define basic math and python functions commonly seen in neurophysiology and behavioural neuroscience papers. This repo contains files that are solutions for the course [Basic Introduction to Maths and Python for Neuroscience](https://github.com/john-s-butler-dit/Basic-Introduction-to-Python) taught by [John S Butler](https://johnsbutler.netlify.app/).

Although the repo is created to store the solutions for the course, as and when I come acorss more methods in my work or by reading papers, I will try to update the repo.
